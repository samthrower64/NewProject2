# What Have I learned Today?

### Firstly
Learned most of the basic syntax for using Scala

### Then
We went on to learn about _Variables_, _Type Declaration_ as well as _Immutable/Mutable variables_

### After That
We learned about simple mathematical functions, as well as creating a program that returned if a number was __odd__ or __even__

### Post-Lunch Break
We then went to talk about ___For___ Loops, ___While___ Loops, ___IfElse conditionals___ as well as the ForEach function.
